    “Ho, every one who thirsts,
     come to the waters;
    and he who has no money,
     come, buy and eat!
    Come, buy wine and milk
     without money and without price.
    2 Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread,
     and your labor for that which does not satisfy?
    Hearken diligently to me, and eat what is good,
     and delight yourselves in fatness.
    3 Incline your ear, and come to me;
     hear, that your soul may live;
    and I will make with you an everlasting covenant,
     my steadfast, sure love for David.
    4 Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples,
     a leader and commander for the peoples.
    5 Behold, you shall call nations that you know not,
     and nations that knew you not shall run to you,
    because of the Lord your God, and of the Holy One of Israel,
     for he has glorified you.
    6 “Seek the Lord while he may be found,
     call upon him while he is near;
    7 let the wicked forsake his way,
     and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
    let him return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on him,
     and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
    8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
     neither are your ways my ways, says the Lord.
    9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
     so are my ways higher than your ways
     and my thoughts than your thoughts.
    10 “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,
     and return not thither but water the earth,
    making it bring forth and sprout,
     giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
    11 so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth;
     it shall not return to me empty,
    but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,
     and prosper in the thing for which I sent it.
    12 “For you shall go out in joy,
     and be led forth in peace;
    the mountains and the hills before you
     shall break forth into singing,
     and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
    13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress;
     instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle;
    and it shall be to the Lord for a memorial,
     for an everlasting sign which shall not be cut off.”
    -Isaiah 55

    5 For this very reason make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue,
    and virtue with knowledge,
    6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness,
    and steadfastness with godliness,
    7 and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.
    8 For if these things are yours and abound,
    they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful
    in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    9 For whoever lacks these things is blind and shortsighted
    and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.
    10 Therefore, brethren, be the more zealous to confirm your call and election,
    for if you do this you will never fall;
    11 so there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom
    of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
    -2 Peter 1

    7 Do not be deceived; God is not mocked,
    for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
    8 For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption;
    but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
    9 And let us not grow weary in well-doing,
    for in due season we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.
    10 So then, as we have opportunity,
    let us do good to all men,
    and especially to those who are of the household of faith.
    -Galatians 6

    You cannot serve both God and wealth.
    All peoples, listen –
    all who live in the world, hear what I have to say:
    humble and great together,
    rich and poor alike!
    My mouth will speak wisdom,
    my inmost thoughts will bring good counsel.
    I will turn my ears to a mystery,
    I will expound a riddle on the lyre.
    Why should I be fearful in times of trouble,
    when the crimes of usurpers hem me in?
    They trust in their own strength
    and glory in their great riches.
    But, after all, man cannot redeem himself,
    he cannot ransom himself before God.
    The price of his soul’s redemption is too great,
    he cannot pay it –
    the price of eternal death avoided.
    He will see that even the wise die;
    the foolish and the stupid too will perish,
    and their riches will pass to others.
    Their tombs will be homes to them for ever,
    their dwelling-place for all generations,
    even if the lands they owned are named after them.
    Though he be full of honour, man will not endure:
    he is like the beasts of burden, that die;
    he is like the beasts that perish.
    Glory be to the Father and to the Son
    and to the Holy Spirit,
    as it was in the beginning,
    is now, and ever shall be,
    world without end.
    Amen.
    You cannot serve both God and wealth.
    Psalm 48 (49)

    Build up treasure for yourselves in heaven, says the Lord.
    Those who trust in themselves – this is the road they take.
    This is the end of those who boast.
    Like sheep they go down into the underworld,
    and death is their shepherd.
    They will fall headlong into the grave:
    their faces will be eaten away,
    and the underworld will be their dwelling-place.
    But God will ransom my life;
    truly he will lift me from the grasp of the underworld.
    Do not fear, when a man becomes rich
    and the glory of his house increases.
    When he dies, he will not take it with him,
    his glory will not follow him down to the grave.
    Even if he calls himself blessed,
    says “see how they praise me for my success,”
    still he will join his fathers,
    cut off from light, for ever.
    Though he be full of honour, yet he does not understand.
    He is like the beasts of burden, that die;
    he is like the beasts that perish.
    Glory be to the Father and to the Son
    and to the Holy Spirit,
    as it was in the beginning,
    is now, and ever shall be,
    world without end.
    Amen.

    Build up treasure for yourselves in heaven, says the Lord.

    <b>Matthew 6</b>
    <u><i>RSV</i></u>
    19 “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth,
    where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal,
    20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
    where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal.
    21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.



    <b>Psalm 93</b>
    <u><i>KJV</i></u>
    3 The floods have lifted up, O Lord,
    the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
    4 The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,
    yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
    5 Thy testimonies are very sure:
    holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for ever.

    <i><u>RSV</u></i>
    3 The floods have lifted up, O Lord,
    the floods have lifted up their voice,
    the floods lift up their roaring.
    4 Mightier than the thunders of many waters,
    mightier than the waves of the sea,
    the Lord on high is mighty!
    5 Thy decrees are very sure;
    holiness befits thy house,
    O Lord, for evermore.

  <b>1 Kings 2</b>
  2 When David’s time to die drew near, he charged Solomon his son, saying, 
  2 “I am about to go the way of all the earth.<b></b> Be strong, and show yourself a man,</b>
  3 and keep the charge of the Lord your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, 
  his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, 
  that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn;
