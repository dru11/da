    <h1>Devotional</h1>
    <h3><pre><i>“Love is the only way to grasp another human being
      in the innermost core of his personality.
      No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being
      unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled
      to see the essential traits and features in the beloved
      person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him,
      which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized.
      Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the
      beloved person to actualize these potentialities.
      By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should
      become, he makes these potentialities come true.”</i>
― Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning</pre></h3>

    <p><pre><i>
      <b>Sirach 14</b>
      20 Blessed is the man who meditates on[c] wisdom
      and who reasons intelligently.
      21 He who reflects in his mind on her ways
      will also ponder her secrets.
      22 Pursue wisdom[d] like a hunter,
      and lie in wait on her paths.
      23 He who peers through her windows
      will also listen at her doors;
      24 he who encamps near her house
      will also fasten his tent peg to her walls;
      25 he will pitch his tent near her,
      and will lodge in an excellent lodging place;
      26 he will place his children under her shelter,
      and will camp under her boughs;
      27 he will be sheltered by her from the heat,
      and will dwell in the midst of her glory.</pre></p>

   <p>"Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil;
     May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the power of God,
     thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Amen."<br>
     V. Our help is in the name of the Lord. R. Who made heaven and earth.
Most gracious Virgin Mary, thou who wouldst crush the head of the serpent, protect us from the vengeance of the evil one. We offer our prayers, supplications, sufferings and good works to thee so that thou may purify them, sanctify them and present them to thy Son as a perfect offering. May this offering be given so that the demons that influence or seek to influence the members of the Auxilium Christianorum do not know the source of their expulsion and blindness. Blind them so that they know not our good works. Blind them so that they know not on whom to take vengeance. Blind them so that they may receive the just sentence for their works. Cover us with the Precious Blood of thy Son so that we may enjoy the protection which flows from His Passion and Death. Amen.
St. Michael Prayer. Guardian Angel Prayer. Our Father. Hail Mary. Glory Be.
Litany of the Most Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
Lord have mercy.
Christ have mercy.
Lord have mercy.
Christ hear us.
Christ graciously hear us.
God the Father of Heaven, have mercy on us.
God the Son, Redeemer of the world, have mercy on us. God the Holy Spirit, have mercy on us.
Holy Trinity, One God, have mercy on us.
Blood of Christ, only-begotten Son of the Eternal Father, save us. Blood of Christ, Incarnate Word of God, save us.
Blood of Christ, of the New and Eternal Testament, save us.
Blood of Christ, falling upon the earth in the Agony, save us.
Blood of Christ, shed profusely in the Scourging, save us.
Blood of Christ, flowing forth in the Crowning with Thorns, save us. Blood of Christ, poured out on the Cross, save us.
Blood of Christ, price of our salvation, save us.
Blood of Christ, without which there is no forgiveness, save us. Blood of Christ, Eucharistic drink and refreshment of souls, save us.</p>
