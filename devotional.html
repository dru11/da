    <h3><pre><i>“Love is the only way to grasp another human being
      in the innermost core of his personality.
      No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being
      unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled
      to see the essential traits and features in the beloved
      person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him,
      which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized.
      Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the
      beloved person to actualize these potentialities.
      By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should
      become, he makes these potentialities come true.”</i>
― Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning</pre></h3>

    <p><pre><i>
      <b>Sirach 14</b>
      20 Blessed is the man who meditates on[c] wisdom
      and who reasons intelligently.
      21 He who reflects in his mind on her ways
      will also ponder her secrets.
      22 Pursue wisdom[d] like a hunter,
      and lie in wait on her paths.
      23 He who peers through her windows
      will also listen at her doors;
      24 he who encamps near her house
      will also fasten his tent peg to her walls;
      25 he will pitch his tent near her,
      and will lodge in an excellent lodging place;
      26 he will place his children under her shelter,
      and will camp under her boughs;
      27 he will be sheltered by her from the heat,
      and will dwell in the midst of her glory.</pre></p>
