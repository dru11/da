            <h3>A Morning Offering through St. Joseph</h3>
      Receive me, dear and chosen Father, and the offering of every
      movement of my body and soul, which I desire to present
      through thee to my blessed Lord.

      Purify all! Make all a perfect holocaust! May every pulsation
      of my heart be a Spiritual Communion, every look and
      thought an act of love, every action a sweet sacrifice,
      every word an arrow of Divine love, every step
      an advance toward Jesus, every visit to Our Lord as
      pleasing to God as the errands of Angels, every thought
      of thee, dear Saint, an act to remind thee that I am thy child.

      I recommend to thee the occasions in which I usually fail,
      particularly . . . [Mention these]. Accept each little devotion
      of the day, though replete with imperfection, and offer it
      to Jesus, Whose mercy will overlook all, since He
      regards not so much the gift as the love of the giver.
      Amen.

      <h3>THE YEAR OF ST. JOSEPH PRAYER</h3>
      To you, O blessed Joseph (Ad te, beate Ioseph)
      To you, O blessed Joseph, do we come in our afflictions, and having implored the help of your most holy Spouse,
      we confidently invoke your patronage also.
      Through that charity which bound you to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God and through the paternal love with which you embraced the Child Jesus,
      we humbly beg you graciously to regard the inheritance which Jesus Christ has purchased by his Blood,
      and with your power and strength to aid us in our necessities.
      O most watchful guardian of the Holy Family, defend the chosen children of Jesus Christ;
      O most loving father, ward off from us every contagion of error and corrupting influence;
      O our most mighty protector, be kind to us and from heaven assist us in our struggle with the power of darkness.
      As once you rescued the Child Jesus from deadly peril, so now protect Godâ€™s Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity;
      shield, too, each one of us by your constant protection, so that, supported by your example and your aid, we may be able to live piously,
      to die in holiness, and to obtain eternal happiness in heaven.
      Amen.

                                      <h3>Prayer Before Work to St. Joseph the Worker</h3>
        O Glorious Saint Joseph, model of all those who are devoted to labor, obtain for me the grace to work in a spirit of penance
        for the expiation of my many sins; to work conscientiously, putting the call of duty above my natural inclinations;
        to work with thankfulness and joy, considering it an honor to employ and develop by means of labor the gifts received from God;
        to work with order, peace, moderation, and patience, never shrinking from weariness and trials;
        to work above all with purity of intention and detachment from self, keeping unceasingly before my eyes death
        and the account that I must give of time lost, talents unused, good omitted, and vain complacency in success, so fatal to the work of God.
              All for Jesus, all through Mary, all after thy example, O Patriarch, Saint Joseph.
              Such shall be my watch-word in life and in death. Amen. (Composed by Pope St. Pius X)
