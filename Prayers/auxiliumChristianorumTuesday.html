      V. Our help is in the name of the Lord.
      R. Who made heaven and earth.

      Most gracious Virgin Mary, thou who wouldst crush the head of the serpent,
protect us from the vengeance of the evil one. We offer our prayers, supplications,
sufferings and good works to thee so that thou may purify them,
sanctify them and present them to thy Son as a perfect offering.
May this offering be given so that the demons that influence
or seek to influence the members of the Auxilium Christianorum do not
know the source of their expulsion and blindness. Blind them so that they know not
our good works. Blind them so that they know not on whom to take vengeance.
Blind them so that they may receive the just sentence for their works.
Cover us with the Precious Blood of thy Son so that we may enjoy the protection
which flows from His Passion and Death. Amen. <br>

Let us pray.
Almighty, and everlasting God, Who hast appointed Thine only-begotten Son to be the Redeemer of the world,
and hast been pleased to be reconciled unto us by His Blood, grant us, we beseech Thee,
so to venerate with solemn worship the price of our salvation,
that the power thereof may here on earth keep us from all things hurtful,
and the fruit of the same may gladden us for ever hereafter in heaven. Through the same Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

<u><i>On Tuesdays </i></u><br>

On Tuesdays:
Lord Jesus Christ, we beg Thee for the grace to remain guarded beneath the protective mantle of Mary,
surrounded by the holy briar from which was taken the Holy Crown of Thorns, and saturated with Thy Precious Blood in the power of the Holy Spirit,
with our Guardian Angels, for the greater glory of the Father. Amen.

August Queen of the Heavens, heavenly Sovereign of the Angels, Thou who from the beginning hast received from God the power
and the mission to crush the head of Satan, we humbly beseech Thee to send thy holy legions, so that under Thy command and through Thy power,
they may pursue the demons and combat them everywhere, suppress their boldness, and drive them back into the abyss. O good and tender Mother,
Thou wilt always be our love and hope! O Divine Mother, send Thy Holy Angels to defend us and to drive far away from us the cruel enemy.
Holy Angels and Archangels, defend us, guard us. Amen.

Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us.
Mary, Help of Christians, pray for us.
Virgin Most Powerful, pray for us.
St. Joseph, pray for us.
St. Michael the Archangel, pray for us.
All You Holy Angels, pray for us.

In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
