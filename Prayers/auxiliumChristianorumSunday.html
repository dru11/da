      V. Our help is in the name of the Lord.
      R. Who made heaven and earth.

      Most gracious Virgin Mary, thou who wouldst crush the head of the serpent,
protect us from the vengeance of the evil one. We offer our prayers, supplications,
sufferings and good works to thee so that thou may purify them,
sanctify them and present them to thy Son as a perfect o//ffering.
May this offering be given so that the demons that influence
or seek to influence the members of the Auxilium Christianorum do not
know the source of their expulsion and blindness. Blind them so that they know not
our good works. Blind them so that they know not on whom to take vengeance.
Blind them so that they may receive the just sentence for their works.
Cover us with the Precious Blood of thy Son so that we may enjoy the protection
which flows from His Passion and Death. Amen. <br>

Let us pray.
Almighty, and everlasting God, Who hast appointed Thine only-begotten Son to be the Redeemer of the world,
and hast been pleased to be reconciled unto us by His Blood, grant us, we beseech Thee,
so to venerate with solemn worship the price of our salvation,
that the power thereof may here on earth keep us from all things hurtful,
and the fruit of the same may gladden us for ever hereafter in heaven. Through the same Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

<u><i>On Sundays:</i></u><br>

O Glorious Queen of Heaven and Earth, Virgin Most Powerful, thou who hast the power
to crush the head of the ancient serpent with thy heel, come and exercise this power flowing
from the grace of thine Immaculate Conception. Shield us under the mantle of thy purity and love,
draw us into the sweet abode of thy heart and annihilate and render impotent the forces bent on destroying us.
Come Most Sovereign Mistress of the Holy Angels and Mistress of the Most Holy Rosary,
thou who from the very beginning hast received from God the power and the mission to crush the head of Satan.
Send forth thy holy legions, we humbly beseech thee, that under thy command and by thy power they may pursue the evil spirits,
counter them on every side, resist their bold attacks and drive them far from us, harming no one
on the way, binding them to the foot of the Cross to be judged and sentenced by Jesus Christ Thy Son and to be disposed of by Him as He wills.
St. Joseph, Patron of the Universal Church, come to our aid in this grave battle against the forces of darkness,
repel the attacks of the devil and free the members of the Auxilium Christianorum,
and those for whom the priests of the Auxilium Christianorum pray, from the strongholds of the enemy.
St. Michael, summon the entire heavenly court to engage their forces in this fierce battle against the powers of hell.
Come O Prince of Heaven with thy mighty sword and thrust into hell Satan and all the other evil spirits. O Guardian Angels,
guide and protect us. Amen.

August Queen of the Heavens, heavenly Sovereign of the Angels, Thou who from the beginning hast received from God
the power and the mission to crush the head of Satan, we humbly beseech Thee to send thy holy legions,
so that under Thy command and through Thy power, they may pursue the demons and combat them everywhere,
suppress their boldness, and drive them back into the abyss. O good and tender Mother,
Thou wilt always be our love and hope! O Divine Mother, send Thy Holy Angels to defend us
and to drive far away from us the cruel enemy. Holy Angels and Archangels, defend us, guard us. Amen.

Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us.
Mary, Help of Christians, pray for us.
Virgin Most Powerful, pray for us.
St. Joseph, pray for us.
St. Michael the Archangel, pray for us.
All You Holy Angels, pray for us.

In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
