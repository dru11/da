 17. In the Church's evangelizing activity there are of course certain elements and aspects to be specially insisted on.
 Some of them are so important that there will be a tendency simply to identify them with evangelization. Thus it has been possible
 to define evangelization in terms of proclaiming Christ to those who do not know Him, of preaching, of catechesis, of conferring Baptism
 and the other sacraments.
Any partial and fragmentary definition which attempts to render the reality of evangelization in all its richness, complexity and dynamism
does so only at the risk of impoverishing it and even of distorting it. It is impossible to grasp the concept of evangelization unless one
tries to keep in view all its essential elements.
These elements were strongly emphasized at the last Synod, and are still the subject of frequent study, as a result of the Synod's work.
 We rejoice in the fact that these elements basically follow the lines of those transmitted to us by the Second Vatican Council, especially
 in "Lumen gentium," "Gaudium et spes" and "Ad gentes."
18. For the Church, evangelizing means bringing the Good News into all the strata of humanity, and through its influence transforming humanity
from within and making it new: "Now I am making the whole of creation new."[46] But there is no new humanity if there are not first of all new
persons renewed by Baptism[47] and by lives lived according to the Gospel.[48] The purpose of evangelization is therefore precisely this interior
change, and if it had to be expressed in one sentence the best way of stating it would be to say that the Church evangelizes when she seeks to
convert,[49] solely through the divine power of the message she proclaims, both the personal and collective consciences of people, the activities
in which they engage, and the lives and concrete milieu which are theirs.
19. Strata of humanity which are transformed: for the Church it is a question not only of preaching the Gospel in ever wider geographic areas or
to ever greater numbers of people, but also of affecting and as it were upsetting, through the power of the Gospel, mankind's criteria of judgment,
determining values, points of interest, lines of thought, sources of inspiration and models of life, which are in contrast with the Word of God and
the plan of salvation.
20. All this could he expressed in the following words: what matters is to evangelize man's culture and cultures (not in a purely decorative way, as
it were, by applying a thin veneer, but in a vital way, in depth and right to their very roots), in the wide and rich sense which these terms have in
Gaudium et spes,[50] always taking the person as one's starting-point and always coming back to the relationships of people among themselves and with
God.
The Gospel, and therefore evangelization, are certainly not identical with culture, and they are independent in regard to all cultures. Nevertheless,
the kingdom which the Gospel proclaims is lived by men who are profoundly linked to a culture, and the building up of the kingdom cannot

8
 avoid borrowing the elements of human culture or cultures. Though independent of cultures, the Gospel and evangelization are not necessarily
 incompatible with them; rather they are capable of permeating them all without becoming subject to any one of them.
The split between the Gospel and culture is without a doubt the drama of our time, just as it was of other times. Therefore every effort must
be made to ensure a full evangelization of culture, or more correctly of cultures. They have to be regenerated by an encounter with the Gospel.
But this encounter will not take place if the Gospel is not proclaimed.
21. Above all the Gospel must be proclaimed by witness. Take a Christian or a handful of Christians who, in the midst of their own community,
show their capacity for understanding and acceptance, their sharing of life and destiny with other people, their solidarity with the efforts of
all for whatever is noble and good. Let us suppose that, in addition, they radiate in an altogether simple and unaffected way their faith in values
that go beyond current values, and their hope in something that is not seen and that one would not dare to imagine. Through this wordless witness
these Christians stir up irresistible questions in the hearts of those who see how they live: Why are they like this? Why do they live in this way?
What or who is it that inspires them? Why are they in our midst? Such a witness is already a silent proclamation of the Good News and a very
powerful and effective one. Here we have an initial act of evangelization. The above questions will ask, whether they are people to whom Christ
has never been proclaimed, or baptized people who do not practice, or people who live as nominal Christians but according to principles that are
in no way Christian, or people who are seeking, and not without suffering, something or someone whom they sense but cannot name. Other questions
will arise, deeper and more demanding ones, questions evoked by this witness which involves presence, sharing, solidarity, and which is an
essential element, and generally the first one, in evangelization."[51]
All Christians are called to this witness, and in this way they can be real evangelizers. We are thinking especially of the responsibility
incumbent on immigrants in the country that receives them.
22. Nevertheless this always remains insufficient, because even the finest witness will prove ineffective in the long run if it is not explained,
justified - what Peter called always having "your answer ready for people who ask you the reason for the hope that you all have"[52] - and made
explicit by a clear and unequivocal proclamation of the Lord Jesus. The Good News proclaimed by the witness of life sooner or later has to be
proclaimed by the word of life. There is no true evangelization if the name, the teaching, the life, the promises, the kingdom and the mystery
of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God are not proclaimed. The history of the Church, from the discourse of Peter on the morning of Pentecost onwards,
has been intermingled and identified with the history of this proclamation. At every new phase of human history, the Church, constantly gripped by
the desire to evangelize, has but one preoccupation: whom to send to proclaim the mystery of Jesus? In what way is this mystery to be proclaimed?
How can one ensure that it will resound and reach all those who should hear it? This proclamation - kerygma, preaching or

9
 catechesis - occupies such an important place in evangelization that it has often become synonymous with it; and yet it is only one aspect of
 evangelization.
23. In fact the proclamation only reaches full development when it is listened to, accepted and assimilated, and when it arouses a genuine adherence
in the one who has thus received it. An adherence to the truths which the Lord in His mercy has revealed; still more, an adherence to a program of
life - a life henceforth transformed - which He proposes. In a word, adherence to the kingdom, that is to say, to the "new world," to the new state
of things, to the new manner of being, of living, of living in community, which the Gospel inaugurates. Such an adherence, which cannot remain
abstract and unincarnated, reveals itself concretely by a visible entry into a community of believers. Thus those whose life has been transformed
enter a community which is itself a sign of transformation, a sign of newness of life: it is the Church, the visible sacrament of salvation.[53]
Our entry into the ecclesial community will in its turn be expressed through many other signs which prolong and unfold the sign of the Church.
In the dynamism of evangelization, a person who accepts the Church as the Word which saves[54] normally translates it into the following sacramental
acts: adherence to the Church, and acceptance of the sacraments, which manifest and support this adherence through the grace which they confer.
24. Finally, the person who has been evangelized goes on to evangelize others. Here lies the test of truth, the touchstone of evangelization: it is
unthinkable that a person should accept the Word and give himself to the kingdom without becoming a person who bears witness to it and proclaims it
in his turn.
To complete these considerations on the meaning of evangelization, a final observation must be made, one which we consider will help to clarify the
reflections that follow.
Evangelization, as we have said, is a complex process made up of varied elements: the renewal of humanity, witness, explicit proclamation, inner
adherence, entry into the community, acceptance of signs, apostolic initiative. These elements may appear to be contradictory, indeed mutually
exclusive. In fact they are complementary and mutually enriching. Each one must always be seen in relationship with the others. The value of the
last Synod was to have constantly invited us to relate these elements rather than to place them in opposition one to the other, in order to reach
a full understanding of the Church's evangelizing activity.
It is this global vision which we now wish to outline, by examining the content of evangelization and the methods of evangelizing and by clarifying
to whom the Gospel message is addressed and who today is responsible for it.
25. In the message which the Church proclaims there are certainly many secondary elements. Their presentation depends greatly on changing
circumstances. They themselves also change. But there is the essential content, the living substance, which cannot be modified or ignored

10
 without seriously diluting the nature of evangelization itself.
26. It is not superfluous to recall the following points: to evangelize is first of all to bear witness, in a simple and direct way, to God
revealed by Jesus Christ, in the Holy Spirit, to bear witness that in His Son God has loved the world - that in His Incarnate Word He has given
being to all things and has called men to eternal life. Perhaps this attestation of God will be for many people the unknown God[55] whom they
adore without giving Him a name, or whom they seek by a secret call of the heart when they experience the emptiness of all idols. But it is fully
evangelizing in manifesting the fact that for man the Creator is not an anonymous and remote power; He is the Father: "...that we should be called
children of God; and so we are."[56] And thus we are one another's brothers and sisters in God.
27. Evangelization will also always contain - as the foundation, center, and at the same time, summit of its dynamism - a clear proclamation that,
in Jesus Christ, the Son of God made man, who died and rose from the dead, salvation is offered to all men, as a gift of God's grace and mercy.[57]
And not an immanent salvation, meeting material or even spiritual needs, restricted to the framework of temporal existence and completely identified
with temporal desires, hopes, affairs and struggles, but a salvation which exceeds all these limits in order to reach fulfillment in a communion with
the one and only divine Absolute: a transcendent and eschatological salvation, which indeed has its beginning in this life but which is fulfilled in
eternity.
28. Consequently evangelization cannot but include the prophetic proclamation of a hereafter, man's profound and definitive calling, in both
continuity and discontinuity with the present situation: beyond time and history, beyond the transient reality of this world, and beyond the
things of this world, of which a hidden dimension will one day be revealed - beyond man himself, whose true destiny is not restricted to his temporal
aspect but will be revealed in the future life.[58] Evangelization therefore also includes the preaching of hope in the promises made by God in the
new Covenant in Jesus Christ; the preaching of God's love for us and of our love for God; the preaching of brotherly love for all men - the capacity
of giving and forgiving, of self-denial, of helping one's brother and sister - which, springing from the love of God, is the kernel of the Gospel;
the preaching of the mystery of evil and of the active search for good. The preaching likewise - and this is always urgent - of the search for God
Himself through prayer which is principally that of adoration and thanksgiving, but also through communion with the visible sign of the encounter
with God which is the Church of Jesus Christ; and this communion in its turn is expressed by the application of those other signs of Christ
living and acting in the Church which are the sacraments. To live the sacraments in this way, bringing their celebration to a true fullness,
is not, as some would claim, to impede or to accept a distortion of evangelization: it is rather to complete it. For in its totality,
evangelization - over and above the preaching of a message - consists in the implantation of the Church, which does not exist without the
driving force which is the sacramental life culminating in the Eucharist.[59]

11
 29. But evangelization would not be complete if it did not take account of the unceasing interplay of the Gospel and of man's concrete life,
 both personal and social. This is why evangelization involves an explicit message, adapted to the different situations constantly being realized,
 about the rights and duties of every human being, about family life without which personal growth and development is hardly possible,[60] about
 life in society, about international life, peace, justice and development- a message especially energetic today about liberation.
30. It is well known in what terms numerous bishops from all the continents spoke of this at the last Synod, especially the bishops from the
Third World, with a pastoral accent resonant with the voice of the millions of sons and daughters of the Church who make up those peoples.
Peoples, as we know, engaged with all their energy in the effort and struggle to overcome everything which condemns them to remain on the
margin of life: famine, chronic disease, illiteracy, poverty, injustices in international relations and especially in commercial exchanges,
situations of economic and cultural neo-colonialism sometimes as cruel as the old political colonialism. The Church, as the bishops repeated,
has the duty to proclaim the liberation of millions of human beings, many of whom are her own children- the duty of assisting the birth of this
liberation, of giving witness to it, of ensuring that it is complete. This is not foreign to evangelization.
31. Between evangelization and human advancement- development and liberation- there are in fact profound links. These include links of an
anthropological order, because the man who is to be evangelized is not an abstract being but is subject to social and economic questions.
They also include links in the theological order, since one cannot dissociate the plan of creation from the plan of Redemption. The latter plan
touches the very concrete situations of injustice to be combated and of justice to be restored. They include links of the eminently evangelical
order, which is that of charity: how in fact can one proclaim the new commandment without promoting in justice and in peace the true, authentic
advancement of man? We ourself have taken care to point this out, by recalling that it is impossible to accept "that in evangelization one
could or should ignore the importance of the problems so much discussed today, concerning justice, liberation, development and peace in the world.
This would be to forget the lesson which comes to us from the Gospel concerning love of our neighbor who is suffering and in need."[61]
The same voices which during the Synod touched on this burning theme with zeal, intelligence and courage have, to our great joy, furnished the
enlightening principles for a proper understanding of the importance and profound meaning of liberation, such as it was proclaimed and achieved
by Jesus of Nazareth and such as it is preached by the Church.
32. We must not ignore the fact that many, even generous Christians who are sensitive to the dramatic questions involved in the problem of
liberation, in their wish to commit the Church to the liberation effort are frequently tempted to reduce her mission to the dimensions of a
simply temporal project. They would reduce her aims to a man-centered goal; the salvation of which she is the messenger would be reduced to
material well-being. Her activity, forgetful of all spiritual and

12
 religious preoccupation, would become initiatives of the political or social order. But if this were so, the Church would lose her fundamental
 meaning. Her message of liberation would no longer have any originality and would easily be open to monopolization and manipulation by
 ideological systems and political parties. She would have no more authority to proclaim freedom as in the name of God. This is why we have
 wished to emphasize, in the same address at the opening of the Synod, "the need to restate clearly the specifically religious finality of
 evangelization. This latter would lose its reason for existence if it were to diverge from the religious axis that guides it: the kingdom of God,
 before anything else, in its fully theological meaning...."[62]
33. With regard to the liberation which evangelization proclaims and strives to put into practice one should rather say this:
- it cannot be contained in the simple and restricted dimension of economics, politics, social or cultural life; it must envisage the whole man,
in all his aspects, right up to and including his openness to the absolute, even the divine Absolute;
- it is therefore attached to a view of man which it can never sacrifice to the needs of any strategy, practice or short-term efficiency.
34. Hence, when preaching liberation and associating herself with those who are working and suffering for it, the Church is certainly not willing
to restrict her mission only to the religious field and dissociate herself from man's temporal problems. Nevertheless she reaffirms the primacy of
her spiritual vocation and refuses to replace the proclamation of the kingdom by the proclamation of forms of human liberation- she even states
that her contribution to liberation is incomplete if she neglects to proclaim salvation in Jesus Christ.
35. The Church links human liberation and salvation in Jesus Christ, but she never identifies them, because she knows through revelation,
historical experience and the reflection of faith that not every notion of liberation is necessarily consistent and compatible with an
evangelical vision of man, of things and of events; she knows too that in order that God's kingdom should come it is not enough to establish
liberation and to create well-being and development.
And what is more, the Church has the firm conviction that all temporal liberation, all political liberation- even if it endeavors to find its
justification in such or such a page of the Old or New Testament, even if it claims for its ideological postulates and its norms of action
theological data and conclusions, even if it pretends to be today's theology- carries within itself the germ of its own negation and fails to
reach the ideal that it proposes for itself whenever its profound motives are not those of justice in charity, whenever its zeal lacks a truly
spiritual dimension and whenever its final goal is not salvation and happiness in God.
36. The Church considers it to be undoubtedly important to build up structures which are more

13
 human, more just, more respectful of the rights of the person and less oppressive and less enslaving, but she is conscious that the best structures
 and the most idealized systems soon become inhuman if the inhuman inclinations of the human heart are not made wholesome, if those who live in
 these structures or who rule them do not undergo a conversion of heart and of outlook.
37. The Church cannot accept violence, especially the force of arms- which is uncontrollable once it is let loose- and indiscriminate death as the
path to liberation, because she knows that violence always provokes violence and irresistibly engenders new forms of oppression and enslavement
which are often harder to bear than those from which they claimed to bring freedom. We said this clearly during our journey in Colombia: "We
exhort you not to place your trust in violence and revolution: that is contrary to the Christian spirit, and it can also delay instead of
advancing that social uplifting to which you lawfully aspire."[63] "We must say and reaffirm that violence is not in accord with the Gospel,
that it is not Christian; and that sudden or violent changes of structures would be deceitful, ineffective of themselves, and certainly not in
conformity with the dignity of the people."[64]
38. Having said this, we rejoice that the Church is becoming ever more conscious of the proper manner and strictly evangelical means that she
possesses in order to collaborate in the liberation of many. And what is she doing? She is trying more and more to encourage large numbers of
Christians to devote themselves to the liberation of men. She is providing these Christian "liberators" with the inspiration of faith, the
motivation of fraternal love, a social teaching which the true Christian cannot ignore and which he must make the foundation of his wisdom and
of his experience in order to translate it concretely into forms of action, participation and commitment. All this must characterize the spirit
of a committed Christian, without confusion with tactical attitudes or with the service of a political system. The Church strives always to insert
the Christian struggle for liberation into the universal plan of salvation which she herself proclaims.
What we have just recalled comes out more than once in the Synod debates. In fact we devoted to this theme a few clarifying words in our address
to the Fathers at the end of the assembly.[65]
It is to be hoped that all these considerations will help to remove the ambiguity which the word "liberation" very often takes on in ideologies,
political systems or groups. The liberation which evangelization proclaims and prepares is the one which Christ Himself announced and gave to man
by His sacrifice.
39. The necessity of ensuring fundamental human rights cannot be separated from this just liberation which is bound up with evangelization and
which endeavors to secure structures safeguarding human freedoms. Among these fundamental human rights, religious liberty occupies a place of
primary importance. We recently spoke of the relevance of this matter, emphasizing "how many Christians still today, because they are Christians,
because they are Catholics, live oppressed by systematic persecution! The drama of fidelity to Christ and of the freedom of religion

14
 continues, even if it is disguised by categorical declarations in favor of the rights of the person and of life in society!"[66]
40. The obvious importance of the content of evangelization must not overshadow the importance of the ways and means.
This question of "how to evangelize" is permanently relevant, because the methods of evangelizing vary according to the different circumstances of
time, place and culture, and because they thereby present a certain challenge to our capacity for discovery and adaptation.
On us particularly, the pastors of the Church, rests the responsibility for reshaping with boldness and wisdom, but in complete fidelity to the
content of evangelization, the means that are most suitable and effective for communicating the Gospel message to the men and women of our times.
Let it suffice, in this meditation, to mention a number of methods which, for one reason or another, have a fundamental importance.
41. Without repeating everything that we have already mentioned, it is appropriate first of all to emphasize the following point: for the Church,
the first means of evangelization is the witness of an authentically Christian life, given over to God in a communion that nothing should destroy
and at the same time given to one's neighbor with limitless zeal. As we said recently to a group of lay people, "Modern man listens more willingly to witnesses than to teachers, and if he does listen to teachers, it is because they are witnesses."[67] St. Peter expressed this well when he held up the example of a reverent and chaste life that wins over even without a word those who refuse to obey the word.[68] It is therefore primarily by her conduct and by her life that the Church will evangelize the world, in other words, by her living witness of fidelity to the Lord Jesus- the witness of poverty and detachment, of freedom in
the face of the powers of this world, in short, the witness of sanctity.
42. Secondly, it is not superfluous to emphasize the importance and necessity of preaching. "And how are they to believe in him of whom they have
never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher?... So faith comes from what is heard and what is heard comes by the preaching of
Christ."[69] This law once laid down by the Apostle Paul maintains its full force today.
Preaching, the verbal proclamation of a message, is indeed always indispensable. We are well aware that modern man is sated by talk; he is obviously
often tired of listening and, what is worse, impervious to words. We are also aware that many psychologists and sociologists express the view that
modern man has passed beyond the civilization of the word, which is now ineffective and useless, and that today he lives in the civilization of the
image. These facts should certainly impel us to employ, for the purpose of transmitting the Gospel message, the modern means which this civilization
has produced. Very positive efforts have in fact already been made in this sphere. We

15
 cannot but praise them and encourage their further development. The fatigue produced these days by so much empty talk and the relevance of many
 other forms of communication must not however diminish the permanent power of the word, or cause a loss of confidence in it. The word remains ever
 relevant, especially when it is the bearer of the power of God.[70] This is why St. Paul's axiom, "Faith comes from what is heard,"[71] also
 retains its relevance: it is the Word that is heard which leads to belief.
43. This evangelizing preaching takes on many forms, and zeal will inspire the reshaping of them almost indefinitely. In fact there are
innumerable events in life and human situations which offer the opportunity for a discreet but incisive statement of what the Lord has to say in
this or that particular circumstance. It suffices to have true spiritual sensitivity for reading God's message in events. But at a time when the
liturgy renewed by the Council has given greatly increased value to the Liturgy of the Word, it would be a mistake not to see in the homily an
important and very adaptable instrument of evangelization. Of course it is necessary to know and put to good use the exigencies and the possibilities
of the homily, so that it can acquire all its pastoral effectiveness. But above all it is necessary to be convinced of this and to devote oneself
to it with love. This preaching, inserted in a unique way into the Eucharistic celebration, from which it receives special force and vigor,
certainly has a particular role in evangelization, to the extent that it expresses the profound faith of the sacred minister and is impregnated
with love. The faithful assembled as a Paschal Church, celebrating the feast of the Lord present in their midst, expect much from this preaching,
and will greatly benefit from it provided that it is simple, clear, direct, well-adapted, profoundly dependent on Gospel teaching and faithful to
the magisterium, animated by a balanced apostolic ardor coming from its own characteristic nature, full of hope, fostering belief, and productive
of peace and unity. Many parochial or other communities live and are held together thanks to the Sunday homily, when it possesses these qualities.
Let us add that, thanks to the same liturgical renewal, the Eucharistic celebration is not the only appropriate moment for the homily. The homily
has a place and must not be neglected in the celebration of all the sacraments, at paraliturgies, and in assemblies of the faithful. It will always
be a privileged occasion for communicating the Word of the Lord.
44. A means of evangelization that must not be neglected is that of catechetical instruction. The intelligence, especially that of children and
young people, needs to learn through systematic religious instruction the fundamental teachings, the living content of the truth which God has
wished to convey to us and which the Church has sought to express in an ever richer fashion during the course of her long history. No one will
deny that this instruction must be given to form patterns of Christian living and not to remain only notional. Truly the effort for evangelization
will profit greatly- at the level of catechetical instruction given at church, in the schools, where this is possible, and in every case in
Christian homes- if those giving catechetical instruction have suitable texts, updated with wisdom and competence, under the authority
of the bishops. The methods must be adapted to the age, culture and aptitude of the persons concerned, they must
