  <h3>All Characters</h3>

  Character List:
  Katniss Everdeen - The main character and narrator of the story. Katniss describes herself to be similar to Gale's appearance, with the same dark hair and olive skin. She is sixteen years old and attends a secondary school somewhere in District 12. She's often quiet and "not gossipy" in public and is generally liked by District 12's residents. Katniss is an excellent hunter, archer, and trapper, skilled just like her late father. She is the sole provider for her family and hunts illegally in forest near her home in the Seam. She's very intolerant of the Capitol. Katniss loves her little sister Prim more than anything in the world. Katniss is often called "Catnip" by Gale.

  Peeta Mellark - The 16 year old male tribute from District 12. He is described as being "medium height, stocky build" and has "ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead". He is the town bakers' son and is talented in baking breads and cakes. He has had a secret liking for Katniss since they were five and seems to continue to through the Games. He is rarely moody or upset and generally takes things lightly.

  Haymitch Abernathy - A "paunchy, middle-aged man" who was the victor of the 50th Hunger Games. He acts as a mentor for Peeta and Katniss before they enter the Games. He is often sarcastic and anything but sober, which is very annoying to Katniss. He has a great liking for white liquor and is constantly drunk, creating a bad image for District 12.

  Gale Hawthorne - An 18 year old from the Seam who is Katniss's best friend. He taught Katniss how to set snares when they ran into each other four years prior to the events of The Hunger Games. Katniss also taught him how to arch. He is an outgoing person while in the woods with Katniss. He trades at the Hob, the black market located within an abandoned warehouse, with her and helps provide for her family and vice-versa.

  Effie Trinket - A bubbly and goofy woman from the Capitol who wears colourful wigs, usually in the shade of hot pink. She reaps the names of the tributes in District 12 and escorts them to the Capitol and (very rarely) back. She is annoying, but somewhat likable.

  Primrose Everdeen - Katniss's twelve year old sister. She is slender with long blond hair and blue eyes. She is adored by District 12 and later the Capitol after her sister won the Hunger Games. She is a skilled healer, like her mother. She is generally optimistic and happy, even in a dark situation. She was the tribute reaped to go to the Capitol before Katniss took her place.

  Mrs. Everdeen - Katniss's mother. Now slightly "beaten-down" and frail, she used to be incredibly beautiful. As a child, she worked in an apothecary shop with her parents and later owned the business. As many of District 12's population cannot afford a doctor, they take their ill and wounded to Mrs. Everdeen. She continues to hide her pain and grief from her husband's death inside until Katniss begs her to not let Prim starve.

  Madge Undersee - Mayor Undersee's sixteen year old daughter. She and Katniss have always had a connection to each other, if not a friendship. Like Katniss, she doesn't like to gossip and isn't very "girlish". Before the games, Madge gave Katniss a golden pin in the shape of a mockingjay (a genetically enhanced hybrid of a mockingbird and a jabber jay that can mimic human song) to keep with her as a piece of home.

  Rue - The 12 year old tribute from District 11 who bears a resemblance to Prim. Katniss feels sorry for her, and she is befriended by Katniss after Rue saved her from a nasty nest of genetically enhanced hornets.

  Avox Girl- In both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, there is no mention of the Avox girl's real name. The Avox girl is a fugitive who was fleeing to District 13 with a boy, but was caught by a Capitol hovercraft. During her attempted escape, Katniss and Gale witnessed her being caught, and the boy she was with (who was killed). Later on, when Katniss goes to the Hunger Games, she see's the girl as an Avox, someone who serves for the Capitol and was turned into a mute.

  Characters
  Katniss Everdeen – Mrs. Everdeen – Prim Everdeen – Gale Hawthorn – Greasy Sae – Effie Trinket
  Places
  Everdeen home – The Seam – The Meadow – The Hob – The Square – Mayor’s home


  We first meet Katniss Everdeen, 16, as she wakes in the morning. She has a younger sister, Prim, and a mother.
  Prim is described as fresh and lovely as the primrose for which she was named. We also meet Prim’s cat, Buttercup.
  When Prim brought him home, she tried to drown it because she didn’t need another mouth to feed. He has distrusted her since.
  Katniss gets out of bed, and goes hunting but not before grabbing the goat cheese Prim left for her.
  Where Katniss lives is called the Seam and is part of District 12. District 12 is where coal is found and mining is what the men and
  women of the Seam do for work. But for today, everyone is inside their homes. Katniss heads to the Meadow and
  to a fence that it usually electrified. Since the town is lucky to get a few hours of electricity per day,
  she listens and then crawls under it into the woods. She grabs her bow and arrows that her father made from a hollow log.
  Her father taught her how to find food in the woods before he died. He died in a mine explosion when she was 11.
  Trespassing into the woods and hunting is illegal but most would risk it if they had the weapons.
  The District’s Peacekeepers also turn a blind eye because they also want to fresh meat and are some of their best customers.
  In the woods is the only person with whom she can be herself, Gale. Gale calls her Catnip, which is what he thought
  she said when they first met. After a lynx started following her, the name stuck. Katniss goes to a rock ledge overlooking a
  valley where she finds Gale. He has bread and Katniss pulls out the cheese that Prim left and they eat it along with berries.
  Gale and Katniss look alike with their straight black hair, olive skin, and gray eyes. They are not related, but most who live
  in the Seam look this way except Prim and her mother, who have light hair and blue eyes. Gale says that they could leave the district
  and live in the woods if they didn’t have so many people to take care of. Katniss is irritated because the idea of leaving is preposterous.
  There is nothing romantic between Katniss and Gale but she is jealous of the way other girls talk about Gale because good hunting partners are
  hard to find. They leave their fishing poles at the lake and go and gather in the woods. They end up with a dozen fish, a bag of greens, and a
  gallon of strawberries. Before they head home they go to the Hob, the black market in a abandoned warehouse. They trade fish for bread and salt,
  and Greasy Sae, the old woman who sells soup, exchanges greens for paraffin. They go to the mayor’s house to sell half of the strawberries.
  His daughter, Madge, opens the door and is dressed nicely for reaping day. Madge and Katniss are usually stuck together at school since neither
  really have a group of friends. Gale said that she had a pretty dress and Madge makes a harmless statement about how if she goes to the Capitol
  she wants to look nice. Gales tells her she won’t because she has so few entries in the reaping. Madge gives Katniss the money and they leave.
  She doesn’t like how Gale took a dig at Madge but she knows Gale is right. At age 12, you get your name entered once and and at 13, twice.
  Every year you get another entry. For everyone in each of the 12 districts in their country, Panem, it is the same. But if you are poor and
  starving, you can get the tesserae in exchange for another entry. Each tesserae is a year’s worth of oil and grain for one person.
  You can do this for every member of the family. The entries are cumulative. So at the age of 12, Katniss had four entries.
  This year at the age of 16, she has twenty entries. Gale who is eighteen with a family of five, has forty-two entries.
  So with how things work, it is hard to be angry with those who don’t need to take the tesserae. They divide their spoils and head home.
  Prim and her mother are getting ready and have set a dress out for Katniss to wear. At one o’clock, they head for the town square.
  The square is surrounded by camera crews and banners. People file into the square and the 12 through 18 year old are herded into a
  roped off area with the oldest in the front. As the square begins to fill District 12′s population of eight-thousand, the kids focus
  on the stage in front of the Justice building. It has three chairs, a podium, and two giant glass balls with names of the boys and girls.
  Mayor Undersee, a tall balding man, and Effie Trinket, District 12′s escort with pink hair and a spring green suit fill two of the chairs.
  The clock strikes two and the mayor reads the history of Panem, formerly North America. There was a brutal war and what was left after,
  was a Capitol with thirteen districts. Later the Dark Days came, an uprising against the Capitol. Twelve districts were defeated and the
  thirteenth destroyed. In punishment for the Dark Days were the Hunger Games. Every year, each district provides one boy and one girl,
  called tributes. The twenty-four tributes will be put in a arena and must fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins.
  Taking the kids and forcing them to kill each other while the Capitol watches is how they say that the districts are at their mercy and
  there is nothing they can do about it. They are forced to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity. The last tribute alive gets a life of
  ease at home and the district is showered with gifts, mostly food. The mayor reads the past victors and District 12 has had two in seventy-four years.
  The only one alive is Haymitch Abernathy. He is a paunchy, middle-aged man. He staggers onto the stage and sits in the third chair.
  He is drunk and is usually always this way. Effie Trinket goes to the podium and talks about what an honor it is to be at District 12.
  She goes to the bowl that holds the girls’ names and picks out a slip of paper. It is not Katniss. It is Prim Everdeen.
