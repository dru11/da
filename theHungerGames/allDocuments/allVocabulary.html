The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins

Context: What’s the story behind the story?

Dystopia: A dystopia is the often futuristic vision of a society in which conditions of life are miserable and characterized by poverty, oppression, war, violence and/or terror, resulting in widespread unhappiness, suffering, and other kinds of pain.

Author’s background:

Collins says that the idea for The Hunger Games came to her one day when she was channel-surfing, and the lines between a reality show competition and war coverage "began to blur in this very unsettling way.” She also cites the Greek myth of Theseus, in which the city of Athens was forced to send young men and women to Crete to be devoured by the Minotaur as inspiration for the nation of Panem; she explains, "Crete was sending a very clear message: 'Mess with us and we'll do something worse than kill you. We'll kill your children.' After writing the novel, Collins signed a six-figure deal for three books with Scholastic in 2006. As of 2009, there are 500,000 copies of The Hunger Games in print and 26 foreign editions; rights to the novel have been sold in 37 territories.

Collins's career began in 1991 as a writer for children's television shows. She worked on several television shows for Nickelodeon, including Clarissa Explains It All, The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo, Little Bear, and Oswald. She was also the head writer for Scholastic Entertainment's Clifford's Puppy Days. She received a Writers Guild of America nomination in animation for co-writing the critically acclaimed Christmas special, Santa, Baby!

After meeting children's author James Proimos while working on the Kids' WB show Generation O!, Collins was inspired to write children's books herself. Her inspiration for Gregor the Overlander, the first book of The New York Times best-selling series “The Underland Chronicles,” came from Alice in Wonderland, when she was thinking about how one was more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole, and would find something other than a tea party. Collins also wrote a rhyming picture book illustrated by Mike Lester entitled When Charlie McButton Lost Power. Gregor and the Code of Claw, the last book of The Underland Chronicles, was released in 2007.

Collins’ novel entitled The Hunger Games, the first of a trilogy, was released in September 2008 by Scholastic Press. This was followed by the novel's sequel, Catching Fire, in September 2009. She is working on the third book of the trilogy, Mockingjay, which is tentatively slated for an August 24, 2010 release.

Collins lives in Connecticut with her family and three feral kittens –more wild than domestic. Her daughter is 10, and her son 15. She earned her Master’s Degree in Fine Arts from New York University in Dramatic Writing.

Character List:
Katniss Everdeen - The main character and narrator of the story. Katniss describes herself to be similar to Gale's appearance, with the same dark hair and olive skin. She is sixteen years old and attends a secondary school somewhere in District 12. She's often quiet and "not gossipy" in public and is generally liked by District 12's residents. Katniss is an excellent hunter, archer, and trapper, skilled just like her late father. She is the sole provider for her family and hunts illegally in forest near her home in the Seam. She's very intolerant of the Capitol. Katniss loves her little sister Prim more than anything in the world. Katniss is often called "Catnip" by Gale.

Peeta Mellark - The 16 year old male tribute from District 12. He is described as being "medium height, stocky build" and has "ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead". He is the town bakers' son and is talented in baking breads and cakes. He has had a secret liking for Katniss since they were five and seems to continue to through the Games. He is rarely moody or upset and generally takes things lightly.

Haymitch Abernathy - A "paunchy, middle-aged man" who was the victor of the 50th Hunger Games. He acts as a mentor for Peeta and Katniss before they enter the Games. He is often sarcastic and anything but sober, which is very annoying to Katniss. He has a great liking for white liquor and is constantly drunk, creating a bad image for District 12.

Gale Hawthorne - An 18 year old from the Seam who is Katniss's best friend. He taught Katniss how to set snares when they ran into each other four years prior to the events of The Hunger Games. Katniss also taught him how to arch. He is an outgoing person while in the woods with Katniss. He trades at the Hob, the black market located within an abandoned warehouse, with her and helps provide for her family and vice-versa.

Effie Trinket - A bubbly and goofy woman from the Capitol who wears colourful wigs, usually in the shade of hot pink. She reaps the names of the tributes in District 12 and escorts them to the Capitol and (very rarely) back. She is annoying, but somewhat likable.

Primrose Everdeen - Katniss's twelve year old sister. She is slender with long blond hair and blue eyes. She is adored by District 12 and later the Capitol after her sister won the Hunger Games. She is a skilled healer, like her mother. She is generally optimistic and happy, even in a dark situation. She was the tribute reaped to go to the Capitol before Katniss took her place.

Mrs. Everdeen - Katniss's mother. Now slightly "beaten-down" and frail, she used to be incredibly beautiful. As a child, she worked in an apothecary shop with her parents and later owned the business. As many of District 12's population cannot afford a doctor, they take their ill and wounded to Mrs. Everdeen. She continues to hide her pain and grief from her husband's death inside until Katniss begs her to not let Prim starve.

Madge Undersee - Mayor Undersee's sixteen year old daughter. She and Katniss have always had a connection to each other, if not a friendship. Like Katniss, she doesn't like to gossip and isn't very "girlish". Before the games, Madge gave Katniss a golden pin in the shape of a mockingjay (a genetically enhanced hybrid of a mockingbird and a jabber jay that can mimic human song) to keep with her as a piece of home.

Rue - The 12 year old tribute from District 11 who bears a resemblance to Prim. Katniss feels sorry for her, and she is befriended by Katniss after Rue saved her from a nasty nest of genetically enhanced hornets.

Avox Girl- In both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, there is no mention of the Avox girl's real name. The Avox girl is a fugitive who was fleeing to District 13 with a boy, but was caught by a Capitol hovercraft. During her attempted escape, Katniss and Gale witnessed her being caught, and the boy she was with (who was killed). Later on, when Katniss goes to the Hunger Games, she see's the girl as an Avox, someone who serves for the Capitol and was turned into a mute.

Extended Response Questions:

Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are the winners of the 74th Hunger Games. We have had a chance to get to know these two characters pretty well and it seems like we actually know them as “real” people. Which one of these two characters is the better contestant in the Hunger Games?
In your essay, be sure to:
	Choose a character and explain (using at least three reasons/examples) why this person is the better overall contestant in the Hunger Games
	Choose a character and explain (using at least three reasons/examples) why this person is NOT the better overall contestant in the Hunger Games
	Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation in composing your response


According to many people, the term “sacrifice” is defined as: “giving something up for the sake of something else.“ In The Hunger Games, people and, sometimes things, are sacrificed for many reasons; some of these reasons make sense, while others seem pretty crazy.  How do we see Katniss and Peeta making sacrifices throughout the games?
In your essay, be sure to:
•	Discuss and explain some of the sacrifices that Peeta makes for Katniss
•	Discuss and explain some of the sacrifices that Katniss makes for her family and for Peeta
•	Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation in composing your response
A lot of times, when we read books, we find ourselves identifying with, and relating to, certain characters while, on the same note, we realize which characters we really cannot stand. There are usually one or two characters that you really feel connected with and there are also one or two characters that you really dislike. If you were to meet the characters from The Hunger Games in “real life,” which one do you feel that you would connect with the best and which character do you think that you would probably not get along with?

A Conversation with Suzanne Collins

Q: You have said from the start that The Hunger Games story was intended as a trilogy. Did it actually end the way you planned it from the beginning?
A: Very much so. While I didn’t know every detail, of course, the arc of the story from gladiator game, to revolution, to war, to the eventual outcome remained constant throughout the writing process.
Q: We understand you worked on the initial screenplay for a film to be based on The Hunger Games. What is the biggest difference between writing a novel and writing a screenplay?
A: There were several significant differences. Time, for starters. When you’re adapting a novel into a two-hour movie you can’t take everything with you. The story has to be condensed to fit the new form. Then there’s the question of how best to take a book told in the first person and present tense and transform it into a satisfying dramatic experience. In the novel, you never leave Katniss for a second and are privy to all of her thoughts so you need a way to dramatize her inner world and to make it possible for other characters to exist outside of her company. Finally, there’s the challenge of how to present the violence while still maintaining a PG-13 rating so that your core audience can view it. A lot of things are acceptable on a page that wouldn’t be on a screen. But how certain moments are depicted will ultimately be in the director’s hands.
Q: Are you able to consider future projects while working on The Hunger Games, or are you immersed in the world you are currently creating so fully that it is too difficult to think about new ideas?
A: I have a few seeds of ideas floating around in my head but—given that much of my focus is still on The Hunger Games—it will probably be awhile before one fully emerges and I can begin to develop it.
Q: The Hunger Games is an annual televised event in which one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts is forced to participate in a fight-to-the-death on live TV. What do you think the appeal of reality television is—to both kids and adults?
A: Well, they’re often set up as games and, like sporting events, there’s an interest in seeing who wins. The contestants are usually unknown, which makes them relatable. Sometimes they have very talented people performing.
Then there’s the voyeuristic thrill—watching people being humiliated, or brought to tears, or suffering physically—which I find very disturbing. There’s also the potential for desensitizing the audience, so that when they see real tragedy playing out on, say, the news, it doesn’t have the impact it should.
Q: If you were forced to compete in the Hunger Games, what do you think your special skill would be?
A: Hiding. I’d be scaling those trees like Katniss and Rue. Since I was trained in sword-fighting, I guess my best hope would be to get hold of a rapier if there was one available. But the truth is I’d probably get about a four in Training.
-continued-2
Q: You weave action, adventure, mythology, sci-fi, romance, and philosophy throughout The Hunger Games. What influenced the creation of The Hunger Games?
A: A significant influence would have to be the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. The myth tells how in punishment for past deeds, Athens periodically had to send seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, where they were thrown in the Labyrinth and devoured by the monstrous Minotaur.
Even as a kid, I could appreciate how ruthless this was. Crete was sending a very clear message: “Mess with us and we’ll do something worse than kill you. We’ll kill your children.” And the thing is, it was allowed; the parents sat by powerless to stop it. Theseus, who was the son of the king, volunteered to go. I guess in her own way, Katniss is a futuristic Theseus.
In keeping with the classical roots, I send my tributes into an updated version of the Roman gladiator games, which entails a ruthless government forcing people to fight to the death as popular entertainment. The world of Panem, particularly the Capitol, is loaded with Roman references. Panem itself comes from the expression “Panem et Circenses” which translates into “Bread and Circuses.”
The audiences for both the Roman games and reality TV are almost characters in themselves. They can respond with great enthusiasm or play a role in your elimination.
I was channel surfing between reality TV programming and actual war coverage when Katniss’s story came to me. One night I’m sitting there flipping around and on one channel there’s a group of young people competing for, I don’t know, money maybe? And on the next, there’s a group of young people fighting an actual war. And I was tired, and the lines began to blur in this very unsettling way, and I thought of this story.
Q: The trilogy’s premise is very brutal, yet is handled so tastefully. Was this a difficult balance to achieve?
A: Yes, the death scenes are always hard to write. It’s difficult to put kids in violent situations—Gregor (the protagonist in The Underland Chronicles) is in a war, Katniss is in a gladiator game. Characters will die. It’s not fun to write, but I think if you can’t commit to really doing the idea, it’s probably better to work on another type of story.
Given that, you have to remember who you’re trying to reach with the book. I try and think of how I would tell a particularly difficult event to my own children. Exactly what details they need to know to really understand it, and what would be gratuitous.
Q: The Hunger Games tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others. What drew you to such serious subject matter?
A: That was probably my dad’s influence. He was career Air Force, a military specialist, a historian, and a doctor of political science. When I was a kid, he was gone for a year in Viet Nam. It was very important to him that we understood about certain aspects of life. So, it wasn’t enough to visit a battlefield, we needed to know why the battle occurred, how it played out, and the consequences. Fortunately, he had a gift for presenting history as a fascinating story. He also seemed to have a good sense of exactly how much a child could handle, which is quite a bit.

Q: What do you hope readers will come away with when they read The Hunger Games?
A: Questions about how elements of the book might be relevant in their own lives. And, if they’re disturbing, what they might do about them.
Q: In The Hunger Games, Katniss and Gale have an extensive knowledge of hunting, foraging, wildlife, and survival techniques. What kinds of research did you do, if any?
A: Some things I knew from listening to my dad talking about his childhood. He grew up during the Depression. For his family, hunting was not a sport but a way to put meat on the table. He also knew a certain amount about edible plants. He’d go into the woods and gather all these wild mushrooms and bring them home and sauté them. My mom wouldn’t let any of us go near them! But he’d eat them up and they never harmed him, so I guess he knew which ones were safe, because wild mushrooms can be very deadly.
I also read a big stack of wilderness survival guidebooks. And here’s what I learned: you’ve got to be really good to survive out there for more than a few days.
Q: How long would it take for North America to deteriorate into the world depicted in the books?
A: You’d have to allow for the collapse of civilization as we know it, the emergence of Panem, a rebellion, and seventy-four years of the Hunger Games. We’re talking triple digits.
Q: You have written for television for young children and for middle-grade readers (the New York Times bestselling series The Underland Chronicles). Why did you decide to write for an older audience and how was the experience different?
A: I think the nature of the story dictated the age of the audience from the beginning. Both The Underland Chronicles and The Hunger Games have a lot of violence. But in The Underland Chronicles, even though human characters die, a lot of the conflict takes place between different fantastical species. Giant rats and bats and things. You can skew a little younger that way. Whereas in The Hunger Games, there’s no fantasy element, it’s futuristic sci-fi and the violence is not only human on human, it’s kid on kid. And I think that automatically moves you into an older age range.
I find there isn’t a great deal of difference technically in how you approach a story, no matter what age it’s for. I started out as a playwright for adult audiences. When television work came along, it was primarily for children. But whatever age you’re writing for, the same rules of plot, character, and theme apply. You just set up a world and try to remain true to it. If it’s filled with cuddly animated animals, chances are no one’s going to die. If it’s filled with giant flesh-and-blood rats with a grudge, there’s going to be violence.
Q: What was it like to return to the world of the Hunger Games to write Catching Fire and then Mockingjay?
A: Honestly, I feel like I never left it. The revisions of Book I overlapped with the writing of Book II, just as Book II has overlapped with Book III. Since each book feeds into the next, I feel like part of my brain’s been in Panem continuously.

Q: Do you have every book completely mapped out, or do you have a general idea and then take it from there? Did you run into things that were unexpected plot-wise or character-wise?
A: I’ve learned it helps me to work out the key structural points before I begin a story. The inciting incident, acts, breaks, mid-story reversal, crisis, climax, those sorts of things. I’ll know a lot of what fills the spaces between them as well, but I leave some uncharted room for the characters to develop. And if a door opens along the way, and I’m intrigued by where it leads, I’ll definitely go through it.
Q: How do you typically spend your workday? Do you have a routine as you write?
A: I grab some cereal and sit down to work as soon as possible. The more distractions I have to deal with before I actually begin writing, the harder focusing on the story becomes. Then I work until I’m tapped out, usually sometime in the early afternoon. If I actually write three to five hours, that’s a productive day. Some days all I do is stare at the wall. That can be productive, too, if you’re working out character and plot problems. The rest of the time, I walk around with the story slipping in and out of my thoughts.
Q: You are probably getting a lot of fan mail! What is the most surprising feedback you’ve received for The Hunger Games? (Or, what has surprised you the most about the feedback you’re getting for The Hunger Games.)
A: Probably how differently people view the book. Some are attracted to the dystopian world, others are there for action and adventure, still others for the romance. The readers are defining the book in very personal and exciting ways.
Q: What were some of your favorite novels when you were a teen?
A: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith
The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers
Nineteen Eighty Four by George Orwell
Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy
Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut
A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L’Engle
Lord of the Flies by William Golding
Boris by Jaapter Haar
Germinal by Emile Zola
Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury

“Some Hunger Games Fans upset that Character of Rue is Black”

Lionsgate Film
Amandla Stenberg plays Rue in The Hunger Games.
By Gael Fashingbauer Cooper
Even though the character of Rue in Suzanne Collins' book The Hunger Games is described as having "dark brown skin and eyes," many moviegoers were surprised -- some negatively -- that a young black actress played the role in the film.
In an article headlined "Racist Hunger Games Fans Are Very Disappointed," the blog Jezebel pointed out that a Tumblr site called “Hunger Games Tweets” has been collecting tweets reacting to the casting.
Amandla Stenberg, 13, plays Rue, a 12-year-old tribute from District 11 who fights alongside heroine Katniss Everdeen in the movie's murderous tournament. According to Wikipedia, Stenberg's mother is African-American and her father Danish. She also appeared in the 2011 film Colombiana.
While some of the comments are mere surprise, others are more opinionated. "Why does rue have to be black not gonna lie kinda ruined the movie," wrote one moviegoer on Twitter. Wrote another, "Kk call me racist but when I found out Rue was black her death wasnt as sad #ihatemyself."
Both of those accounts appear to have been deleted from Twitter since Jezebel called out the posts, but numerous other posts quoted on “Hunger Games Tweets’ offer up similar thoughts.
Some tweets also referenced other Hunger Games characters played by black actors, including Rue's fellow District 11 tribute, Thresh, and the "Games" stylist Cinna, played by musician Lenny Kravitz.
Rue's skin color should hardly have been a secret. In addition to being spelled out in the book, Stenberg and Kravitz were among those pictured in individual character posters released back in October.
As the Jezebel article and the Tumblr link spread, a backlash against the racist sentiments appeared on Twitter.
Wrote Michelle Juett, "People disgust me. Rue was great, whatever race you thought she was supposed to be."
And Andria Nicole tweeted, "Heads up: if discovering Rue is black 'ruins' the Hunger Games movie for you, you have a lot bigger issues to worry about than casting."
And by Monday afternoon, the author of “Hunger Games Tweets” had seen some change, posting the message, "The number of Tweets complaining about Rue & Thresh have been greatly reduced and it's all thanks to you guys."
1.	In the original book, which race did the author of The Hunger Games describe Rue as being? What, exactly, did Collins say in the book?
2.	What is the nationality of Amandla Stenberg?
3.	What are some of the cruel and racist things being said about Rue’s character in the movie?
4.	Why was it no secret that characters in the book/movie were black?
5.	How did people react to the racist tweets that were released about Rue?
